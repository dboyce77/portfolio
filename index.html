      <p>Here's a short bio of my background. If you need more information go to my website at:
        <a href="https://dboyce77.github.io/douglasboyce/">Douglas Boyce Web Site</a>
    </p>
    <p>I was born in Kansas City,Misouri. When I was nine years old, my family moved to Florida. I attended elementary,
        Middle School,and High School there. After graduating high school, I joined the US Army. After basic training,
        I was stationed at Fort Bragg,NC and was eventully sent to Germany. After my enlistment, I started college,
        and also joined the US Army reserve. My unit was even called up to Desert Storm/Desert Shield. I eventually,
        finished out my 20 year enlistment in 2000.
    </p>

    <p> I attended college at the University of North Floria, graduating in 1990. I worked for a defense contractor in
        Florida, before moving to Kansas to work for BNSF railway. I got married in 2005, and have worked for a couple
        of defense contractors as a E-Learning Developer.</p>

    <p> Most recently the City of Shawnee, Kansas as a IT Web Developer Intern. The reason I am attending this bootcamp
        is to become a full-stack web developer. I hope to learn alot about web development including HTML, CSS,
        JavaScript, among others, and now the journey begins.</p>
